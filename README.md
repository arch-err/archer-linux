# Archer
Archer is my own configuration of Arch linux. I built this system from the ground up, piecing it together from some minimal yet configurable software I could find.

# My workflow

My everyday workflow is very keyboard-centric. I find using the keyboard and keyboard-based applications much faster and smoother. Due to this my system can be quite difficult to use if you aren't me, since I access all my apps through keybinds that I've memorized. I think this is the best way for someone to use their computer, so I encourage anyone who's reading this to take inspiration from my setup and personalize and optimize your own workflow.
